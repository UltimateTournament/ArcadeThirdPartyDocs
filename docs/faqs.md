# FAQs

## Do I need to use a specific screen resolution for my game?

Nope! We have no fixed resolution. We run the game in fullscreen (on mobile) and nearly-fullscreen (minus the nav bar) on desktop.

You can assume roughly 3:2, but it should work on any resolution. If you're worried about rendering resolution because of performance, just make sure it will run on average machines and not only high-end gaming rig :)
