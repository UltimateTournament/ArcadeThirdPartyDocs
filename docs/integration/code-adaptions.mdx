# Adapting your game

You should only need to make very few changes to your games to make them work well with the Arcade.

Below we list the necessary changes and the SDK functions helping with them. In case you're using a language/framework that 
we don't support yet, just reach out. All you need to create a new SDK (or work without one) is the ability to make a few HTTP calls.

:::caution Attention
Both the game server and client must respect errors.

The Arcade SDK has built-in retry mechanisms, so if it returns an error or fails to initialize, then is error is final and
the server and game client should disconnect and exit.
:::

:::note Game State
Currently the Arcade doesn't support long-running games and therefore no state persistence is provided.
If you're currently using some persistence, just replace it with some in-memory implementation.
:::

## Use a fixed random seed

Probably your game has some kind of randomness to it: Where and when enemies spawn, how the level layout is like, etc.
Now if two players play your game, there is a chance that one player has a significantly easier time than another player.
Outside of the Arcade this is fine as it will average out over many games. 
But for a highly competitive gameplay with money at stake this must not happen.

Every player of the same leaderboard/challenge should get the same level, enemy behavior etc. 
To achieve this you must explicitly set the seed of your random number generator with a seed that we provide to you.

<Tabs groupId="rnd-seed">
<TabItem value="unity" label="Unity">

```cs
private void AutoConnect_OnServerReady()
{
    UnityEngine.Random.InitState(AutoConnect.RandomSeed.GetHashCode());
    // and we should only allow players to join after we setup all randomness
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
alert("TODO");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use our authentication

When a player choses to play your game on the Arcade, then we'll create a token (a secret string) that
proves the player identity, the game they selected and that they had enough funds to join the game.

We pass this token into the iframe in which your game will start, so that you can pass it along to your game server.
The server must use that token then to activate the player session - see next section.


<Tabs groupId="get-token">
<TabItem value="unity" label="Unity">

```cs
private void Start()
{
    var token = ExternalScriptBehavior.Token();
    this.clientApi = new UltimateArcadeGameClientAPI(token, ExternalScriptBehavior.BaseApiServerName());
    //TODO send token to server
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
alert("TODO");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Activate the player session

You need to activate the player's session with the provided token to ensure the connection is legitimate
and to retrieve information about the player, like their display name. If this fails you MUST disconnect them!


<Tabs groupId="activate-session">
<TabItem value="unity" label="Unity">

```cs
private UltimateArcadeGameServerAPI serverApi;
[Command]
private void InitPlayerCmd(string token)
{
    StartCoroutine(serverApi.ActivatePlayer(token,
        pi => UADebug.Log("player joined: " + pi.DisplayName),
        err => UADebug.Log("ERROR player join. TODO KICK PLAYER: " + err)));
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
alert("TODO");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Check win situation on the server only

Make sure that the server is authoritative, this means that because we can't prevent a player from manipulating their local client,
all final decisions must happen on the server.

To make the game appear smooth and lag free, you can use techniques like client-side prediction that let the player move locally,
but the server might respond with a different decision and then the local client must rollback the last move.

## Report win/loss

This is basically the only place that differs between leaderboard games and real-time games. 

### For leaderboard games

<Tabs groupId="shutdown">
<TabItem value="unity" label="Unity">

```cs
private void GameOver()
{
    StartCoroutine(
        this.serverApi.ReportPlayerScore(this.playToken, playerScore,
            () => UADebug.Log("done"), 
            err => UADebug.Log("error:" + err) 
        )
    );
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
alert("TODO");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### For real-time games

<Tabs groupId="shutdown">
<TabItem value="unity" label="Unity">

```cs
private void GameOver()
{
    // player has left the game without losing
    StartCoroutine(
        this.serverApi.SettlePlayer(playerToken,
            () => UADebug.Log("done"), 
            err => UADebug.Log("error:" + err) 
        )
    );
    // player has left lost against the game (e.g. ran into a wall)
    StartCoroutine(
        this.serverApi.SelfDefeatPlayer(playerToken,
            () => UADebug.Log("done"), 
            err => UADebug.Log("error:" + err) 
        )
    );
    // player has left lost against another player
    StartCoroutine(
        this.serverApi.SelfDefeatPlayer(loserPlayerToken, winnerPlayerToken,
            () => UADebug.Log("done"), 
            err => UADebug.Log("error:" + err) 
        )
    );
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
alert("TODO");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Shutdown the game after the session has ended

When the session has finished the server informs the client about this via a game specific message. Then the server 
and the client both can shutdown via their respective methods. 

<Tabs groupId="shutdown">
<TabItem value="unity" label="Unity">

```cs
private void Shutdown()
{
    // on the server
    StartCoroutine(
        this.serverApi.Shutdown(
            () => UADebug.Log("Shutdown requested"), 
            err => UADebug.Log("couldn't request shutdown:" + err) 
        )
    );
    // on the client
    ExternalScriptBehavior.CloseGame();
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
alert("TODO");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
