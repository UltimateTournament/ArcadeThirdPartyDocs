# Challenge Game Integration


## Recording and Replaying Player Input

For Challenge games, half of the players will be creating a challenge, and half will be competing against a challenge. Chances are you will want to show the challenging player the play-through of the first player. For this, the SDK will return you the same input record that was given to the server when the first player played.

You can use this recording to show the ghost of the other player in a platformer, split-screen tower defense round runs, or any other way you might want to show this recording.

The only requirement is that this recording does not impact the gameplay of the challenging player.

Likewise you may use the SDK to record the inputs of the player in a serializable format. The SDK will store these for the challenger.
