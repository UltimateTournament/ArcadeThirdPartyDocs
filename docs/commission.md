# Commission

When players play your game, the arcade takes a 10% commission on all exchanged funds. That means we only take it when it moves from one player to the next.

This occurs when:

1. Players defeat each other in a real-time multiplayer game
2. A leaderboard ends and winners are determined
3. A player wins a game challenge

### How do I see how many players are playing my game?
