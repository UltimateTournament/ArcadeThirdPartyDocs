# Leaderboard and Challenges

Leaderboard and Challenge games are the encouraged game to make on the arcade.

## Leaderboard games

In Leaderboard games, players compete for a high score in a time-based leaderboard. The interval of the leaderboard ranges from days to hours, but is usually 24 hours.

At the end of the leaderboard, the players with the top scores distribute the winning based on their place. For example, a leaderboard distribution might look like:

| Place | Winnings |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st | 70% |
| 2nd | 20% |
| 3rd | 10% |

The winnings are distributed after taking the 10% commission. [Learn more about commission here.](/docs/commission)

## Advantages

Async Multiplayer games are the most successful on the arcade for the following reasons:

1. They don't require concurrent players (players don't need to be playing at the same time)
2. They are not latency sensitive (to the server)
3. They allow for far more depth and detail
4. They allow for players in different timezones to compete against each other
5. They result in far larger prize pools
6. Very easy integration

## Game Examples

#### Platformers and Racers

Players race against each other to complete a platform or racing course in a certain amount of time. The lowest time wins.

#### Bullet-hell

Players compete to get the highest score within a certain amount of time, or try to last as long as possible, in a bullet-hell game.
