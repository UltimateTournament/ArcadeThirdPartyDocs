# Real-time Multiplayer

While real-time multiplayer games are possible ([like cyberworms](https://ultimatearcade.io/cyber-worms) and [cyberworms battle royale](https://ultimatearcade.io/cyber-worms?mode=battle-royale)), they are more difficult to build, integrate, maintain, and monetize.

## Disadvantages

1. Harder to develop a game server
2. Latency sensitive

Third Party support for real-time multiplayer games is not encouraged at this time, and is generally not supported with the exception of rare cases.
