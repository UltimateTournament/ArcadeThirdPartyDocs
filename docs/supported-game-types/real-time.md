# Real-time Multiplayer

While real-time multiplayer games are possible (like [cyberworms](https://ultimatearcade.io/cyber-worms) and [cyberworms battle royale](https://ultimatearcade.io/cyber-worms?mode=battle-royale)), they are more difficult to build, integrate, maintain, and monetize.

## Disadvantages

1. Harder to develop a game server
2. Latency sensitive

Third Party support for real-time multiplayer games is not encouraged at this time. Contact us if you have a real-time game that you think really would profit from the arcade.
