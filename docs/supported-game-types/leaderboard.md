# Leaderboard

Leaderboard games are the encouraged game to make on the arcade.

## Advantages

Async Multiplayer games are the most successful on the arcade for the following reasons:

1. They don't require concurrent players (players don't need to be playing at the same time)
2. They are not latency sensitive (to the server)
3. They allow for far more depth and detail
4. They allow for players in different timezones to compete against each other
5. They result in far larger prize pools
6. Very easy integration

## Examples of Leaderboard Games

#### Platformers and Racers

Players race against each other to complete a platform or racing course in a certain amount of time. The lowest time wins.

#### Bullet-hell

Players compete to get the highest score within a certain amount of time, or try to last as long as possible, in a bullet-hell game.
