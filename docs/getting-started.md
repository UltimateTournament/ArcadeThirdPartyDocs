# Getting Started

Getting your game onto the arcade and start making money with it is easy! Just follow the steps below to get your game integrated to the Ultimate Arcade!

## 0. Contact Us!

Say hello [via mail](mailto:info@ultimatetournament.io) and tell us about your great game. We'll setup the neccessary paperwork and invite you to our developer Discord where you can get support anytime.

## 1. Review Supported Game Types

Figure out which category your game falls under in the [Supported Game Types](/docs/category/supported-game-types). Your game type determines how you will integrate our SDK.

## 2. Integrate the Game and Server SDKs

Integrating with the arcade is as easy as adding a few API calls. Have a look at the [Integration Requirements](/docs/integration/integration-requirements) to get started, then follow the integration steps for your specific game type.

## 3. Submit Your Game for Review

The Ultimate Arcade team will review a final version of your game to be put on the Arcade. We will check for:

1. Proper integration
2. Game mechanics, quality, and performance
3. Bugs, abuse, and exploits

You will also be able to test your game end-to-end on our staging environment.

## 4. Add the Final Touches

Before we can launch the game we need assets for the arcade like preview images and description texts. See the [Final Touches](/docs/integration/final-touches) section for more details.

## 5. Launch!

All the hard work is paying off and on a jointly agreed date, your game will be launched on the Arcade!

To celebrate, we'll hold a special tournament based on your game, and also send you some swag (location dependent).
