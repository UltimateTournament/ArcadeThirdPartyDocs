<!-- # Getting Started

Getting your game onto the Arcade and start making money with it is easy! Just follow the steps below to get your game integrated to the Ultimate Arcade!

## 0. Contact Us!

Drop us a line at support[at]ultimatearcade.io and tell us about your great game. We want to make sure that there are no game mechanics or obstacles that would prevent your game from being compatible with the Arcade before you integrate.

From there we'll setup the necessary paperwork and invite you to our developer Discord where you can get support anytime directly from the team that made the Arcade.

## 1. Review Supported Game Types

Figure out which category your game falls under in the [Supported Game Types](/docs/category/supported-game-types). Your game type determines how you will integrate our SDK.

## 2. Integrate the Game and Server SDKs

Integrating with the Arcade is as easy as adding a few API calls. Have a look at the [Integration Requirements](/docs/integration/integration-requirements) to get started, then follow the integration steps for your specific game type.

## 3. Submit Your Game for Review

The Ultimate Arcade team will review a final version of your game to be put on the Arcade. We will check for:

1. Proper integration
2. Game mechanics, quality, and performance
3. Bugs, abuse, and exploits

You will also be able to test your game end-to-end on our staging environment.

## 4. Add the Final Touches

Before we can launch the game we need assets for the Arcade like preview images and description texts. See the [Final Touches](/docs/integration/final-touches) section for more details.

## 5. Launch!

All the hard work is paying off and on a jointly agreed date, your game will be launched on the Arcade!

To celebrate, we'll hold a special tournament based on your game, and also send you some swag (location dependent). -->
